```bash
appwrite login
```

3. Deploy the everything:

```bash
appwrite push all
```

### Function Deployment Details

For proper function deployment and configuration:

1. Deploy the API function:

   ```bash
   appwrite push function
   ```

2. After deployment, set these environment variables in the Appwrite Console:

   - `DATABASE_ID`: Your Appwrite database ID (typically "portfolio")
   - `EXPERIENCE_COLLECTION_ID`: Your experience collection ID
   - `ORGANIZATION_COLLECTION_ID`: Your team collection ID
   - `PROJECTS_COLLECTION_ID`: Your project collection ID
   - `PROJECTS_BUCKET_ID`: Your storage bucket ID for project images

3. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT` in the web application with your deployed function endpoint.

4. Deploy your web application to your preferred hosting provider (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
